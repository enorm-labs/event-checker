-- V023 named the Greyzone survivor `greyzone` while giving it the display name "Greyzone Concerts",
-- whose slug is `greyzone-concerts`. The next import resolved the credit by that slug, found no row,
-- and minted a second one; the admin API then refused to touch the first, because a PUT recomputes
-- the slug from the name and found it taken (#328). This moves the old row's events onto the row
-- the normalizer now resolves to, and deletes the old one. The same four-step shape as V023, and a
-- no-op where either row is absent.
--
-- Unqualified table names, deliberately: Flyway sets `search_path` from `spring.flyway.schemas`
-- before running this (ADR-004).
